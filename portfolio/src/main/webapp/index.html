      <p>So you want to know something about me...</p>
      <p> Well, here we go. </p>
      <p>
          My full name is Didier Dunia Akilimali, but most Americans find it easy to call me Didi. 
          I was born and raised in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a quick Google search will suffice to know more about my birth palce. 
          After high school, I moved to the United States to study Computer Science and Mathematics which I am not passionate about but I love doing.
          You are probably wondering why I study something that I am not passionate about. My answer to this question cannot fit on this page; however, feel free to hit me up if you want talk about it. 
          For fun, I watch movies or code something up.
